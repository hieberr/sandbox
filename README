Public examples and ideas for future reference as I learn HTML/CSS/PHP.

I am creating a music game which uses many music files exported by Reaper. I export the files so that the parameters I need (NAME, bpm, key, tempo, loop points) are in the name of the audio file.  I needed a simple shell script which would extract these parameters and stick them into a text file while renaming the audio file to just be NAME.wav. Once I have the audio files and their matching text files, I can import all of them into Unity where my custom AudioPlayer can interpret the extra parameters in the text file.
